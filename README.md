# VBA-challenge
Basic assignment: Students are given a large sample dataset of stock data over three given years. Four new columns are to be created: ticker symbol, change in value of stock from beginning to end of the year, percentage change in stock value over the year, and the total stock volume. In addition, the change in value column must be formatted to be filled with green color if a positive value is represented and red color if a negative value is represented. Bonuses include changing the code to operate across all worksheets at once (included), and creating a table which contains the maximum and minimum values for percentage change (not included).
Attached:
-one .bas file for import into grader's machine. It contains the full script for extracting, manipulating, and formatting relevant data from sample stock dataset across all worksheets at once.
-three screenshots (one for each year of data) as .jpeg files of the results of running the script on the dataset.
